Pygame Project

Jesse, Brooke, Ethan, Wesley


IDEAS:

Enemies come to you in the middle of the screen, you pick direction to attack in.

Asteroids - Enemy Spawner, collisons, assets, launcher
 
OLD GAME - Asteroids coming to you as you move, you can teleport, but have a chance to teleport into one, you have to shoot them.

Decided to do the Asteroid game that attacks from each direction but also over time each asteriod will take more play input to be able to destroy
