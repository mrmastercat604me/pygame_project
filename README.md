Jesse, Brooke, Ethan, Wesley


IDEAS:

Enemies come to you in the middle of the screen, you pick direction to attack in.

Asteroids - Enemy Spawner, collisons, assets, launcher
 
OLD GAME - Asteroids coming to you as you move, you can teleport, but have a chance to teleport into one, you have to shoot them.
